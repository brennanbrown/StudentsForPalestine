# üáµüá∏ PALESTINIAN SOLIDARITY RESOURCE LIST

> Compiled by: [MRUSFP](https://www.instagram.com/mrusfp/) (Mount Royal University Students for Palestine)  

## PREAMBLE

This list has been compiled by a small group of students at Mount Royal University in Mohk√≠nstsis, none of whom are Palestinian, Arab, or Muslim themselves. We have made a concerted effort to highlight and amplify the voices, perspectives, goals, and calls to action of those who are. If any of the following information and/or resources exist in contradiction to Palestinian calls to action, please email us at [mrusfp@gmail.com](mailto:mrusfp@gmail.com) or message us on instagram at [MRUSFP](https://www.instagram.com/mrusfp/) if you are able.
Further, MRUSFP acknowledges the important distinction between Anti Semitism and Anti-zionism; we do NOT support Anti Semitism in any way, and encourage those who have witnessed such instances (whether online or in person) to report them.

# SECTION 3--CURRENT INFORMATION AND MISC. INFO

## 3a. WRITING A LETTER TO YOUR LOCAL MP

Calling for a ceasefire: You can call your MP demanding they join a growing number of MPs who are campaigning for the government of Canada to demand a ceasefire.[You can find talking points and instructions on how to call your MP on the Leadnow website4](https://act.leadnow.ca/call-ceasefire/).[You can also send a letter to all Canadian MPs calling for an immediate ceasefire through the National Council of Canadian Muslims website3](https://www.nccm.ca/ceasefire/).

### Template for letter to your local MP

```md
Dear [MP's name], I am writing to you as a constituent of your riding to express my deep concern about the ongoing violence in Palestine. The situation is dire and requires immediate attention from our government.

I urge you to call on the Canadian government to take immediate action to help end the violence and protect the human rights of Palestinians. Specifically, I ask that you call on the Canadian government to:

1. Demand an immediate ceasefire between Israel and Palestine.
2. Condemn Israel's illegal occupation of Palestinian territories and its ongoing human rights abuses against Palestinians.
3. Suspend all arms sales to Israel until it complies with international law and respects the human rights of Palestinians.
4. Support the International Criminal Court's investigation into war crimes committed by Israel in Palestine.

As a Canadian citizen, I believe it is our government's responsibility to stand up for human rights and justice around the world. I am deeply committed to this issue, so much so that I feel compelled to inform you that should you not support the call for a ceasefire and the aforementioned actions, I will never vote for [Your MP's Party] again. You are plainly implicit in an active genocide. Instead, I will vote for the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in the next election, even if it goes against my own interests, to ensure that individuals in office are willing to take a stand on this critical issue.

I urge you to take action on this urgent matter and look forward to your prompt response.

Thank you for your attention to this important issue.

Sincerely, [Your name]
```
