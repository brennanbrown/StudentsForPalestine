## Open Letter to Tim Rahilly and Mount Royal University's Board of Govenors: Immediate and Uncompromising Action Required

We are writing to you with a profound sense of urgency and a weighty demand for action in response to the Israel-Arab war, which is continually escalating and deteriorating. The passive stance of our institution is intolerable when faced with the realities genocide. As members of the global community and as a body of an educational institution within Canada, we cannot continue to stand idly by. The bloodshed must stop, and Mount Royal University must not only vocalize but actualize its commitment to human rights.

* Over 9,370 Palestinians have lost their lives since October 7th of this year, with fatalities including a significant number of women and children, who account for more than 62% of the deaths​.
* Injuries have been reported to exceed 15,273 individuals, adding to the toll of human suffering​.
* A staggering figure of at least 2,329 Palestinians were reported killed by October, underscoring a rapid escalation in the conflict​.
* As of mid-October, the combined death toll in the Gaza Strip and West Bank reached 2,383, with over 10,814 injuries recorded​.

The response thus far from MRU is---in essence---a silent affirmation of the genocide being committed. We must demand from our government that Canada change its course and no longer abstain from ceasefire votes on the international stage. It is incumbent upon us to use every resource, every bit of our collective influence, to lobby for an immediate cessation of hostilities.

We are at a pivotal moment in history where our actions---or lack thereof---will be remembered. Our university has an obligation to embody the principles it teaches. [We must reflect on the history of our own institution's systemic biases and injustices, as reported.](https://calgaryherald.com/news/local-news/toxic-culture-at-mount-royal-university)

We urge the issuing of a new, unambiguous statement that reflects the severity of the situation and MRU's unwavering commitment to peace and justice, and this should be disseminated across all university channels, calling for direct action from every member of the community. Furthermore, MRU must provide tangible ways for individuals to contribute to peace efforts and to aid those affected by the conflict.

Should our calls for a resolute stance be ignored, be assured that the student body and the wider community will not remain silent. We will escalate our efforts, ensuring that our advocacy for the cessation of this conflict is at the forefront of our educational pursuits. In the unfortunate event our voices are not heard, and no change is made---or if we are asked to shut down our efforts, we will not shut down. Students who care about innocent lives outnumber a small but powerful group who runs the school. We will persist and maintain difficulty. There are many modes of protest if we are met with pushback. We will voice our concerns and plead for a ceasefire in every email signature, in every discussion forum post for our classes, in the footer of every page of every assignment, and distribute pins and stickers free of charge. This is a promise of unyielding advocacy for what is just.

We are beyond the point of calls for peace. We demand action; we demand it now. Let it be known that Mount Royal University stands.

We expect a swift response and immediate action.

## Letter to Faculty for Organizing a Die-In Protest to Raise Awareness of the Genocide in Gaza

Dear Professors and Faculty of Mount Royal University,

I am writing to draw your attention to the escalating crisis unfolding in Gaza. As of November 2023, the region is witnessing an unprecedented level of violence and civilian casualties due to the conflict between Israeli forces and Hamas. Recent reports suggest that at least 3,793 people, mostly civilians including more than 1,500 children, have been killed since October 7, with the death toll nearing 9,000. The continuous bombardments have not only resulted in a loss of lives but have also obliterated essential infrastructure, leaving the healthcare system on the brink of collapse amidst a dire shortage of life-saving medication, equipment, and other essential supplies.

In light of these disturbing developments, I believe it is crucial for us, as a community dedicated to education and social justice, to raise our voices against the atrocities and advocate for the innocent lives. I am thus proposing to organize a Die-In Protest at Mount Royal University to raise awareness about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and to urge for an immediate cessation of violence.

I am humbly requesting your support in organizing this protest and would be honored if you could also lend your voice by speaking at the event. Your esteemed presence and insightful words would undoubtedly lend significant weight to our cause and help in mobilizing more support.

Here’s a brief outline of the proposed event:

- **Date and Time:** TBD
- **Venue:** Main Street, Mount Royal University
- **Event Format:** Die-in Protest with speeches from faculty members and guest speakers

The aim of this protest is to:

1. Raise awareness within our community and beyond about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.
2. Advocate for peace and an immediate end to the violence that is causing unimaginable suffering to civilians, especially children.
3. Encourage discussions and actions towards contributing to humanitarian aid efforts.

I believe that together, we can make a significant impact and contribute towards fostering a culture of empathy, awareness, and proactive engagement in global humanitarian issues.

I am open to any suggestions you may have and am more than willing to discuss this further at your convenience. I am looking forward to your positive response and sincerely hope that you will consider supporting this initiative.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Warmest regards,
Emily Beckley (They/Them)
B. Kenneth Brown (He/Him)
